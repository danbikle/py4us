%h2#qs Lab (Quickstart):

%p
  I started this effort by studying many pages I found under this URL:
%p
  %a(href='http://bokeh.pydata.org' target='x')
    http://bokeh.pydata.org
%p I decided that this page is the best place for a Bokeh-Beginner:
%p
  %a(href='http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/quickstart.html' target='x')
    http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/quickstart.html
%p I like to do my development in an account named ann on on an Ubuntu 16 host.
%p If you want to do it my way, you can find a suitable VirtualBox OVA file at the URL listed below:
%p
  %a(href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx3iDDAtxxI4WkttQl84UTN4bVk' target='x')
    https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx3iDDAtxxI4WkttQl84UTN4bVk

%p After you start it with the VirtualBox GUI you should see a login screen.

%p The account is 'ann' and the password is 'a'.

%p After you are logged in, both the ann account and Linux host, should be well suited for this class.

%p If, however, you want to update it with the latest Ubuntu 16 patches you could do that with two shell commands which are listed below:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get upgrade

%p Inside the ann account on this host you will see that I have installed Anaconda Python for you.

%p If you type python at the shell you should see something like this:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash
      ann@ub16aug:~$ 
      ann@ub16aug:~$ python
      Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.1.1 (64-bit)| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:53:06) 
      [GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
      >>> 

%p I can see in the above banner that we have Anaconda 4.1.1 inside the ann account.
%p It was created during the summer of 2016 and it gives us Python 3.5.2
%p That combination of Anaconda and Python is well suited for the exercises in this lab.

%p If, however, you want to use a more recent version of Anaconda then run the shell commands listed below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class01ana2'

%p Next I created the file listed below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class06b10'

%p You should copy the above file into /tmp/b10.py and run it.

%p Some features of the above syntax which I like are listed below:
%ul
  %li We have x, y data in separate lists. I see this as the simplest way to feed values to the graph; I like it.
  %li The API calls used to control title, labels, legend, and line_width are easy to follow.

%p I ran it and saw this in my shell:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash
      dan@hp77:/tmp $ python b10.py 
      dan@hp77:/tmp $ Created new window in existing browser session.

%p Then a browser came to life and served me a page:

%iframe(height='700' width='750' src='/class06/b10.html')

%p What we see above is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript rendered by the browser.
%p It is interactive; use your mouse to move it around and change it.
%p All of that complex syntax was generated by Bokeh.
%p I see Bokeh as mechanism which transforms simple declarations into complex web pages.

%p That is a web page so we should deploy it to Heroku so billions of people can see it.

%p
  In class03 (
  %a(href='/cclasses/class03her10')class03-heroku-demo
  ) we saw how to do that so we should do it again:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class06her1'

%p I did the above steps and now I see b10.html at the URL listed below:
%p
  %a(href='https://bokeh9.herokuapp.com/static/b10.html' target='x')
    https://bokeh9.herokuapp.com/static/b10.html

%h2#b11 Lab (b11.py):

%p I did this lab by creating the file listed below:

.syntax
  %pre

%ul
  %li Several y-values, one x-values.
  %li How to access tools via call to figure()
  %li y_axis_type ="log"
  %li Using circles to decorate some of the lines.

%p I ran it and saw this in my shell:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash
      dan@hp77:/tmp $ python b11.py 
      dan@hp77:/tmp $ Created new window in existing browser session.

%p Then a browser came to life and served me a page:

%iframe(height='700' width='750' src='/class06/b11.html')

%p I commited it to /tmp/bok10 and pushed it to Heroku:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash
      cp /tmp/b11.html /tmp/bok10/static
      cd /tmp/bok10/
      git add .
