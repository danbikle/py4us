%h2#r1 Recipe 1: "Logistic Regression Predictions saved to Postgres"

%p Main idea:
%ul
  %li Ask end-user for stock symbol (ticker)
  %li Ask end-user for year count training size (default: 10)
  %li Ask end-user for feature names
  %li Calculate Logistic Regression Predictions for a series of years
  %li Save Predictions to Postgres DB
  %li Query Predictions from Postgres DB
  %li Report Accuracy of Predictions
  %li Report Effectiveness of Predictions

%p Ingredients:
%ul
  %li Ubuntu 16:
  %li https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx3iDDAtxxI4WWFpemh2ZjViVkk
  %li A list of dates and prices (Default: S&P500, Yahoo might work)
  %li
    %a(href='http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=%5EGSPC' target='x')
      http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=%5EGSPC  
  %li Postgres Database Instance
  %li Postgres Database Role
  %li Postgres Database 

  
%p Expected Result:
%ul
  %li Ticker Accuracy Report
  %li Ticker Effectiveness Report

%p Steps:
%ul
  %li Under Construction

  %li Before I predict the stock market, how many years should I learn from?
  %li When I predict the stock market, what exactly should I predict?
  %li Given a series of prices, what might be predictive about them?
  %li Given a series of dates, what might be predictive about them?
  %li Besides dates and prices, what might be predicive of a ticker?
  %li With a JSON API how to help end-user select an option from choices?
