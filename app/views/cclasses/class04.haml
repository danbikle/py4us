%hr/

%h2#r1 Recipe 1: "Price versus Date Regression"

%p Main idea:
%ul
  %li Fit a straight line through a time-series of prices.
  %li Use the line to predict future prices from future dates.

%p Ingredients:
%ul
  %li A list of dates and prices (Default: S&P500, Yahoo might work)
  %li
    %a(href='http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=%5EGSPC' target='x')
      http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=%5EGSPC  
  %li A start-date and end-date            (From end-user)
  %li A prediction-date after the end-date (From end-user)
  
%p Expected Result:
%ul
  %li One prediction of a price at prediction-date

%p Steps:
%ul
  %li Get sorted list of dates and prices into prices1_df (Yahoo might work)
  %li
    %img(src='/class04/prices1_df2.png')
  %li Get start_date, end_date, and prediction_date (From end-user)
  %li Get list of dates and prices into prices2_df between start_date and end_date 
  %li
    %img(src='/class04/prices2_df2.png')
  %li
    Create list of integers from prices2_df-dates:
    %ul
      %li 0 (or 1) might correspond to earliest date
  %li
    %img(src='/class04/dates2int2.png')
  %li Declare that the list of integers to be "X"
  %li Declare that the corresponding prices be "y"
  %li
    %img(src='/class04/yvsx2.png')
  %li
    Create a Linear Regression model from a suitable API:
    %ul
      %li my favorite: Python sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression
      %li R has glm()
  %li Use model to "fit" straight line to X and y data
  %li
    %img(src='/class04/fittedline2.png')
  %li
    Calculate integer which corresponds to prediction_date:
    %ul
      %li Integer is number of days prediction_date is after start_date
  %li Use the straight line to predict price from prediction_date-integer
  %li
    %img(src='/class04/predictedprice2.png')

%h2#r2 Recipe 2: "Pct-Lead versus Pct-Lag Regression"

%p Main idea:
%ul
  %li Build a scatter-plot of Pct-Lead versus Pct-Lag observations
  %li Fit a straight line through the scatter-plot
  %li Use the line to predict Pct-Lead from Pct-Lag
  %li Collect many predictions for many previous years
  %li Report on accuracy and effectiveness of the many predictions
  %li Decide if I should trust Pct-Lead-prediction for today
  %li If yes, predict Pct-Lead from Pct-Lag; then act on prediction
  %li
    %img(src='/class04/scatter2.png')
%p Ingredients:
%ul
  %li A list of dates and prices (Default: S&P500, Yahoo might work)
  %li
    %a(href='http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=%5EGSPC' target='x')
      http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=%5EGSPC
  %li A list of years to test (Default: [2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017]) 
  %li Integer number of years to learn from for each test-year (Default: 25)


%p Steps:
%ul
  %li Get sorted list of dates and prices into prices1_df
  %li
    %img(src='/class04/prices1_df2.png')
  %li Get list of years to test 
  %li
    Get Integer number of years to learn from for each test-year:
    %br/
    call it: train_i
  %li
    Generate pctlead from each price:
    %pre
      %code.python pctlead = 100*(next_price - price)/price
  %li
    Generate pctlag1 from each price:
    %br/
    pctlag1 is pctlead, shifted forward in time once:
    %br/
    [Yesterday's pctlead is today's pctlag1]
    %br/
    Alternative expression:
    %pre
      %code.python pctlag1 = 100*(price - previous_price)/previous_price
  %li Create feat_df from prices1_df, pctlead, pctlag1
  %li
    %img(src='/class04/feat5.png')

  %li
    For each test_yr, Steps:
    %ul
      %li copy test_yr-observations (about 252) from feat_df into test_yr_df
      %li Declare x_test to be test_yr_df.pctlag1
      %li copy train_i-years of observations before test_yr from feat_df into train_df
      %li
        %img(src='/class04/train1.png')
      %li Declare x_train to be train_df.pctlag1
      %li Declare y_train to be train_df.pctlead
      %li Create a Linear Regression model
      %li Use model to "fit" straight line to x_train and y_train
      %li Use the straight line to predict pctlead for each x_test
      %li Copy test_yr_df and predicted pctlead into predictions_df
      %li
        %img(src='/class04/pred3.png')


%p Reporting:
%p Use predictions_df.prediction and predictions_df.pctlead to calculate:
%ul
  %li Accuracy (How often the sign of the prediction is True)
  %li Accuracy above 55% is good
  %li
    Effectiveness:
    %ul
      %li Sum gain of "up"   predictions
      %li Sum gain of "down" predictions
  %li Compare Accuracy and Effectiveness to Accuracy and Effectiveness of "Long-Only" model
