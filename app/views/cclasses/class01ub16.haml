%h2 Class01 Lab Answer:
%h2 Install ub16_201712a.ova inside VirtualBox on your laptop.

%p This is easy.

%p Download this file and then click on it:

%p
  %a(href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/10p1W7kqzxE69jODhUzcb-qi-osN4htO-' target='x')
    ub16_2018_0206.ova [13GB]

%p Be patient, maybe do this at home before class; this is a large file: 13GB

%p The password for the ann account is 'a'.

%p
  The Operating System in this virtualbox is Ubuntu 16.04 which should eventually be better
  than Ubuntu 14.04.

%p This virtualbox should contain recent versions of these languages:
%ul
  %li Python
  %li Ruby
  %li Java
  %li R
  %li Node.js

%p On my laptop I clicked on ub16_2018_0206.ova which brought up an import GUI.

%p After I imported ub16_2018_0206.ova into VirtualBox on my laptop, I ran three shell commands:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get upgrade
      sudo shutdown -r now

%p The last command rebooted the ub16_2018_0206 instance for me.

%p After 3 minutes, ub16_2018_0206 offered me a login screen.

%p At the password prompt for ann I typed in 'a'.

%p A minute later I saw the Ubuntu 16 desktop screen inside a VirtualBox window.
