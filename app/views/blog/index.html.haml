%p Many of the best programmers are "self-taught".

%p But is that true?

%p If I am in a quiet room by myself working through exercises in a Pyton book, is that the optimal way to learn Python?

%p I don't think so.

%p The purpose of this site is to speed up your learning process.

%p Two contexts which help me learn quickly are listed below:
%ul
  %li Solving problems
  %li Social situations

%p An example problem might be: "I should predict the Stock Market."

%p A social situation which significantly speeded my learning as an undergrad at Caltech was to collaborate with fellow students on homework.

%p Lectures at Caltech certainly provided knowledge, but my conversations about a difficult problem-sets in a dorm rooms forced me to learn science and engineering.

%p Another solid path towards learning I found there was getting clues and tips from knowledgeable tutors when my peers lacked insight.

%p When I just got pointed in the right direction with a tiny clue from a TA who did not spoon-feed the answers, then I learned how to solve problems.

%p This site should give you three points of interaction:
%ul
  %li Problem descriptions
  %li Syntax focused at those problems
  %li A social opportunity:
