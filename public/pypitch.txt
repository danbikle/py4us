Hello World,

I invite you to a new Python Class:

"Hands on Python 3.5"

Saturdays 10m to 2pm Jan 07 through Feb 25

Brought to you by Santa Clara Adult Education.

The cost is $300 for 8 weeks of instruction.

Class Description:

In a computer-lab environment we build software projects from most popular Anaconda Python packages.

Why Anaconda?

Anaconda is a high quality Python distribution constructed by a team of experienced engineers.

If you are using a copy of vanilla Python with packages installed by you, then you are doing it wrong.

This is a project based learning opportunity. You can work solo or try to find a coding partner.

If you want to learn Python better, you could use this class and Anaconda Python packages to do that.

If you already know some Python, use this class to build projects from Python packages.

If your project is awesome, you could turn it into a startup.

In the class you will get feedback from peers and advice from an expert software instructor.

Half of class-time will be lecture, half will be hands-on lab.

During the week, between classes, you will have access to online help from the instructor and other students.

All the students will be encouraged to use the same VirtualBox Ubuntu 16 environment with the aim reducing cross-platform problems.

Students who share the same development environment will find collaboration easier.

Additionally the class will provide you an Ubuntu 16 AWS AMI if you want to develop and collaborate over the internet.
